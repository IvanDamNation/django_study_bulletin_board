3) Reworked auth: unique and required email for each account;
4) Account verification via email (in work);
5) Personal page for each account (in work);
6) Commentary for each news (in work);
7) Comment shows up after author accept (in work);
8) Email notification for author about new comment (in work);
9) Weekly user notification about some news on portal (in work).

Requirements: in requirements.txt file (in work)

~~properly installed docker on your machine
For starting server use command in project root directory:
*docker-compose up*
After properly started cluster of three containers (Django, Redis and Celery) you can access project web-interface on localhost address with standard port 8000 (127.0.0.1:8000).~~ (When docker will be ready)


Made for final practice exercise in chapter "Django and backend" for SkillFactory

Superuser:
