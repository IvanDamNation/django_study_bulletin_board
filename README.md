# django_study_seventh

My seventh practice project in Django and HTML


This is simple (actually, it's kinda complex for me) project on Django.


Just made project work with celery-redis-docker stack


Requirements: properly installed docker on your machine



For starting server use command in project root directory:
*docker-compose up*



After properly started cluster of three containers (Django, Redis and Celery) you can access project web-interface on localhost address with standard port 8000 (127.0.0.1:8000).


Made for seventh practice exercise in chapter "Django and backend" for SkillFactory
